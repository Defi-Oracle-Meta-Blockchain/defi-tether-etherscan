# Project TODOs

## Overview
This project aims to connect the DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet to the Ethereum Mainnet using Ethers.js and Web3j. The goal is to ensure that all public transactions on the DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet can be viewed on Etherscan.

## Tasks

### 1. Project Setup
- [x] Initialize a new project directory.
  - **Note**: Ensure the directory structure follows the standard conventions for Java and Node.js projects.
- [x] Set up a Git repository and create an initial commit.
  - **Importance**: Critical for version control and collaboration.
- [x] Create a `README.md` file with an overview of the project.
  - **Note**: Include detailed setup instructions and project goals.

### 2. Install Dependencies
- [x] Install Ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum Mainnet.
  - **Note**: Ensure compatibility with the latest Ethereum network updates.
- [x] Install Web3j for Java-based interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.
  - **Note**: Verify compatibility with Java 11 as specified in the `README.md`.
- [x] Install any other necessary libraries (e.g., dotenv for environment variables).
  - **Note**: Consider using a dependency management tool like Maven for Java and npm for Node.js.

### 3. Configuration
- [x] Create a `.env` file to store environment variables such as API keys, private keys, and network URLs.
  - **Importance**: Critical for security and ease of configuration.
- [x] Set up configuration files for Ethers.js and Web3j.
  - **Note**: Ensure these files are well-documented and include default values for easy setup.

### 4. Connect to DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet
- [x] Write a script to connect to the DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet using Web3j.
  - **Note**: Reference the `BlockchainService.java` for interaction logic.
  - **Code Reference**: 
    ```java:src/main/java/com/defi/services/BlockchainService.java
    startLine: 1
    endLine: 41
    ```
- [x] Ensure the script can fetch public transactions from the DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet.
  - **Note**: Implement error handling and logging for transaction fetching.

### 5. Connect to Ethereum Mainnet
- [x] Write a script to connect to the Ethereum Mainnet using Ethers.js.
  - **Note**: Ensure the script is capable of sending transactions.
- [x] Ensure the script can interact with the Ethereum blockchain and send transactions.
  - **Note**: Implement transaction receipt verification and error handling.

### 6. Transaction Mirroring
- [x] Develop a function to listen for new transactions on the DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet.
  - **Note**: Use the `EventListenerService.java` for event listening logic.
  - **Code Reference**: 
    ```java:src/main/java/com/defi/services/EventListenerService.java
    startLine: 1
    endLine: 128
    ```
- [x] Create a mechanism to mirror these transactions on the Ethereum Mainnet.
  - **Note**: Ensure transactions are correctly formatted and validated before sending.
- [x] Ensure that mirrored transactions are correctly formatted and sent to the Ethereum Mainnet.
  - **Importance**: Critical for the project's main functionality.

### 7. Etherscan Integration
- [x] Verify that mirrored transactions are visible on Etherscan.
  - **Note**: Use the `EtherscanService.java` for API interaction.
  - **Code Reference**: 
    ```java:src/main/java/com/defi/services/EtherscanService.java
    startLine: 1
    endLine: 101
    ```
- [x] Handle any errors or issues that arise during the transaction mirroring process.
  - **Note**: Implement robust error handling and logging.

### 8. Testing
- [x] Write unit tests for all major functions and scripts.
  - **Note**: Use JUnit and Mockito for testing Java components.
  - **Code Reference**: 
    ```java:src/test/java/com/defi/services/TransactionServiceTest.java
    startLine: 1
    endLine: 260
    ```
- [x] Perform integration testing to ensure the entire system works as expected.
  - **Note**: Include tests for cross-chain transaction mirroring.
- [x] Test the system with both testnet and mainnet environments.
  - **Importance**: Critical for ensuring real-world functionality.

### 9. Documentation
- [x] Document the setup and configuration process in the `README.md` file.
  - **Note**: Include detailed instructions and examples.
- [x] Provide detailed instructions on how to run the scripts and mirror transactions.
  - **Note**: Include edge cases and troubleshooting tips.
- [x] Include examples and edge cases in the documentation.
  - **Importance**: Critical for user understanding and adoption.

### 10. Deployment
- [x] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
  - **Note**: Use GitHub Actions as configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
  - **Code Reference**: 
    ```yaml:.github/workflows/ci.yml
    startLine: 1
    endLine: 21
    ```
- [x] Deploy the project to a cloud provider or server.
  - **Note**: Consider using Docker for containerized deployment.
- [x] Monitor the system for any issues and ensure it runs smoothly.
  - **Importance**: Critical for maintaining system reliability.

### 11. Maintenance
- [x] Regularly update dependencies to ensure security and compatibility.
  - **Note**: Use tools like Dependabot for automated dependency updates.
- [x] Monitor the system for any issues and address them promptly.
  - **Note**: Implement logging and alerting for proactive monitoring.
- [x] Continuously improve the system based on feedback and performance metrics.
  - **Importance**: Essential for long-term project success and user satisfaction.
