# Project TODOs

## Overview
This project aims to connect the DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet to the Ethereum Mainnet using Ethers.js and Web3j. The goal is to ensure that all public transactions on the DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet can be viewed on Etherscan.

## Tasks

### 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize a new project directory.
- [ ] Set up a Git repository and create an initial commit.
- [ ] Create a `README.md` file with an overview of the project.

### 2. Install Dependencies
- [ ] Install Ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum Mainnet.
- [ ] Install Web3j for Java-based interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.
- [ ] Install any other necessary libraries (e.g., dotenv for environment variables).

### 3. Configuration
- [ ] Create a `.env` file to store environment variables such as API keys, private keys, and network URLs.
- [ ] Set up configuration files for Ethers.js and Web3j.

### 4. Connect to DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet
- [ ] Write a script to connect to the DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet using Web3j.
- [ ] Ensure the script can fetch public transactions from the DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet.

### 5. Connect to Ethereum Mainnet
- [ ] Write a script to connect to the Ethereum Mainnet using Ethers.js.
- [ ] Ensure the script can interact with the Ethereum blockchain and send transactions.

### 6. Transaction Mirroring
- [ ] Develop a function to listen for new transactions on the DeFi Oracle Meta Mainnet.
- [ ] Create a mechanism to mirror these transactions on the Ethereum Mainnet.
- [ ] Ensure that mirrored transactions are correctly formatted and sent to the Ethereum Mainnet.

### 7. Etherscan Integration
- [ ] Verify that mirrored transactions are visible on Etherscan.
- [ ] Handle any errors or issues that arise during the transaction mirroring process.

### 8. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all major functions and scripts.
- [ ] Perform integration testing to ensure the entire system works as expected.
- [ ] Test the system with both testnet and mainnet environments.

### 9. Documentation
- [ ] Document the setup and configuration process in the `README.md` file.
- [ ] Provide detailed instructions on how to run the scripts and mirror transactions.
- [ ] Include examples and edge cases in the documentation.

### 10. Deployment
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] Deploy the project to a cloud provider or server.
- [ ] Monitor the system for any issues and ensure it runs smoothly.

### 11. Maintenance
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies to ensure security and compatibility.
- [ ] Monitor the system for any issues and address them promptly.
- [ ] Continuously improve the system based on feedback and performance metrics.
